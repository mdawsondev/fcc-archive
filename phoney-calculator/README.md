# Phoney Calculator
A web-based calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to look like a phone.

## Features
The Phoney Calculator was built to be a size-responsive, fully functioning basic calculator. It features a design that looks like a phone on larger windows, while resizing to fit a mobile window. The application also offers functional AC/CE clear functions, and calculation history.

## Notes
This project was completed as part of a freeCodeCamp challenge, and as such, there are no plans for growth at this time. The application was built from scratch, though, and you're welcome to use the source as needed.
