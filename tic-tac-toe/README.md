# Tic-Tac-Zen
Tic-Tac-Zen is a Tic-Tac-Toe game! At the moment it functionally meets the standards for the Free Code Camp reqirement for project competion, but it will be revisited and enhanced down the road. Future versions of Tic-Tac-Zen will include difficulty options, grid-size functionality, and other various features to make it slightly more interesting.
