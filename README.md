# Local Weather
This web-based weather application imports JSON data from the Weather Underground API to provide users with their local data. Features include a mobile-responsive design, light animation, and a color changing theme that alternated based on the time of the day. Basic weather information is displayed in addition to suggestions for wearing a jacket, bringing an umbrella, and using sunscreen (based on the UV index).
