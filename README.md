# Weather App
This web-based weather application imports JSON data from the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to provide users with their local forecast. The location is automaticlaly pulled via a user's IP geodata.

Live Sample: [Weather App on GH Pages](https://mdawsondev.github.io/weather-app).

## Features
Features include a mobile-responsive design, light animation, and a color changing theme that alternates based on the time of the day. Basic weather information is displayed in addition to suggestions for wearing a jacket, bringing an umbrella, and using sunscreen (based on the current UV index).

## Notes
This project was completed as part of a freeCodeCamp challenge, and as such, there are no plans for growth at this time. The application *was* built from scratch, though, and you're welcome to use the source as needed.

The name, Weather App, will remain generic due to the nature of the project.
