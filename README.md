# freeCodeCamp Archive

This repo contains archive-only projects that were required to complete freeCodeCamp's certificate requirements. I have **no intention** of further developing these projects and don't want them cluttering my active repos. That said, they do contain some useful code and are required to remain online to retain the certficiates. I felt that consolidating them into one major repo and archiving them was the most effective way to keep them organized and out of the way.

Projects have been listed by order of completion in ascending order; some contain bugs, others contain poorly written code. These projects were *early learning experiences*, which is why I don't want to spend any more time on them. There are bigger and better projects to move on to!
